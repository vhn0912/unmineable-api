# unMineable - Public API reference
We provide the following public API endpoints for querying accounts stats and information, useful for developers looking to create reporting websites or apps on top of our platform.

### Base URL: https://api.unminable.com/v4

Note that **HTTPS** is required, you can use "api.unmineable.com" or "api.unminable.com" (without the "e") both will work. All responses are in _JSON_ format (**Content-type: application/json** is required). All numbers are returned in string format, with the exception of timestamp values.

### Limits

There is a 500 requests per minute per IP limit. Also every request is cached by 1 second, so there is no need to make more than 1 request per second per endpoint, as the data won't update until a second after.

### Available endpoints

* **GET**  /pool
* **GET**  /coin
* **GET**  /coin/:coin
* **GET**  /address/:address?coin=:coin
* **GET**  /account/:uuid
* **GET**  /account/:uuid/stats
* **GET**  /account/:uuid/workers
* **GET**  /account/:uuid/payments
* **GET**  /account/:uuid/referrals

### GET  /account/:uuid/payments?page=:page_number

Returns the payment list for a specific **uuid**. The list is paginated (10 rows per page), from the most recent to the oldest payout. Note that the current page logic must be implement on client side (should be incremented or decreased depending the current page changes).

Input example:

```
GET https://api.unminable.com/v4/account/A_VALID_UUID/payments?page=1
```

Output example:

```
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Ok",
    "data": {
        "explorer": "https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/", →  Default explorer used on the website, it can be used to append the "tx" field and create a valid link to the tx.
        "coin": "TRX",  → Payment coin
        "list": [
            {
                "tx": "5ee7e976322950653ad38a67f60078ff479291107cce91222c5713c067",  →  Transaction id (on the blockchain) for the payout, can be null if the payment is in pending or error status.
                "amount": "16.020691", → Payment amount
                "timestamp": 1610035918000, → Timestamp of the payment request.
                "status": "success", → Payment status: "pending", "processing", "success" and "error"
                "id": 379743, → Internal id
                "network": "TRX", → Network used for the payout
                "explorer": "https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/", → Base explorer URL (for checking the tx on the blockchain)
                "reason": "INVALID_ADDRESS" → Error in payment reason (only available when the payment is in "error" status.)
            },
            (...up to 10 rows)
        ],
        "has_next": true, → Indicates whether a next page button should be visible (on client side).
        "has_prev": false, → Indicates whether a previous page button should be visible (on client side).
        "last_page": 8  → Last page available (you can run a request to "(...)?page=:last_page" to implement a last page (or oldest payments) button.
    }
}
```

### GET  /account/:uuid/referrals

Returns the referral code for a specific **uuid**.

    "message": "Ok",
